Algorithms, Design Patterns (Gang of Four), Data Structures

While studying data structures, algorithms, and design patterns I decided to create code samples with Visual Studio.

Some of the examples are based on or ported from other examples found arcoss the internet.
Where possible I left notes regarding where the knowledge or code was ported from.

Inside this solution you will find examples of the following:

Design Patterns
  Gang of Four
    All patterns implemented
  
Data Structures
  Hash Tables
      RabinKarp rolling hash for string matching
  
  Tree's
    Self Balancing Tree's
      AVL Tree
      Red Black Tree
  
  Trie
    Dictionary search
    
  Graphs
    DFS - Depth First Search
    BFS - Breadth First Search
    
  Heaps
    Min / Max heap
    Heap Sort

Algorithms
  
  Sorts
    Quick Sort (recursive and iterative)
    Merge Sort (recursive and iterative)
    
Concepts
  Dynamic Programming / Memoization
      Only simple example for fibinacii
