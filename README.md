## Algorithms

Algorithms, Design Patterns (Gang of Four), Data Structures</h2>

While studying data structures, algorithms, and design patterns I decided to create code samples with Visual Studio.  These are not earth shattering examples.  I wrote these examples to further my understanding of the concepts, and I am posting them here on GitHub because I learned all of them from free content available on the internet.  

I leared some of the concepts from YouTube video's ([Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw), [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)), and others from web sites like [Geeks For Geeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).  Where possible I included explainations of the concepts in the code (lots of green comments), and I also listed the sources that I got the information from.  

**Where possible I left notes regarding where the knowledge or code was ported from.**


**NOTE:**While this is a WinForms application, most of the examples only write to the console and do not show any messages in the window.  This is because I mostly worked through the algorithms in the debugger and did not want the code to be muddied with code pushing values to the GUI.
